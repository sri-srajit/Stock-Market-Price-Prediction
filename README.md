# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
An application to predict the prices of Stock Market based on the data of previous days.

## Technical Description
1. A simple application written in python which uses ML techniques to predict the prices.
2. To predict the price application uses Linear Regression ML Algorithm.
3. Libraries used to analyse the data are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
4. Scikit-learn library is used to implement the Linear Regression.
5. GUI is made using TkInter.

## Functionalities
The application uses Linear Regression to predict the data. To predict the price for a particular day, provide the date of the day and the number of days (at least 5 days) to be analysed by Linear Regression Model to predict the price.The application displays the result in a seperate window. The RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error) in the model is .

## Pre-requisites
1. Python
2. Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-Learn

## Limitations
Since the project only uses the data of past few days to predict the price, so its credibility is not very high. It can be used to get some idea of the possible trend of the market.
